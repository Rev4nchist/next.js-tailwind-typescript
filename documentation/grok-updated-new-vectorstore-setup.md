### Key Points
- It seems likely that to fix the semantic search issue in your Next.js personal assistant with memory, you should use cosine distance with the `halfvec` type in Supabase, as OpenAI embeddings are normalized, which suits cosine distance better.
- Research suggests creating an HNSW index with `halfvec_cosine_ops` and updating your Supabase function to use the cosine distance operator `<=>`, starting with a threshold like 1.0.
- The evidence leans toward verifying that embeddings are normalized (norm close to 1.0) and testing with a top-k query to ensure results are returned before adjusting the threshold.

### Direct Answer

#### Overview
You're experiencing issues with semantic searches in your Next.js personal assistant, where searches return zero results despite correct setup. This is likely due to using L2 distance with `halfvec`, which may not be optimal for OpenAI's normalized embeddings. Let's adjust to cosine distance, which is recommended for such embeddings.

#### Steps to Fix
1. **Create a New Index with Cosine Distance:**
   - Drop any existing index on the `knowledge` table to avoid conflicts.
   - Create a new HNSW index using cosine distance, which is better for normalized vectors:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX knowledge_embedding_hnsw_halfvec_cosine_idx
     ON public.knowledge
     USING hnsw ((embedding::halfvec(3072)) halfvec_cosine_ops);
     ```
   - This uses the `halfvec` type, supporting up to 4,000 dimensions, suitable for your 3072-dimensional embeddings.

2. **Update Your Supabase Function:**
   - Modify the `match_knowledge` function to use cosine distance (`<=>`) instead of L2 distance (`<->`):
     ```sql
     CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_knowledge (query_embedding vector(3072), match_threshold float)
     RETURNS SETOF knowledge
     LANGUAGE plpgsql
     AS $$
     BEGIN
       RETURN QUERY
       SELECT *
       FROM knowledge k
       WHERE (k.embedding::halfvec(3072) <=> query_embedding::halfvec(3072)) < match_threshold
       ORDER BY (k.embedding::halfvec(3072) <=> query_embedding::halfvec(3072)) ASC;
     END;
     $$;
     ```
   - Start with a threshold of 1.0 to ensure some results, then adjust based on relevance.

3. **Verify Embedding Normalization:**
   - Check if your stored embeddings are normalized by running:
     ```sql
     SELECT id, l2_norm(embedding) FROM knowledge LIMIT 5;
     ```
   - Ensure the norms are approximately 1.0, as OpenAI embeddings are normalized.

4. **Test with Top-K Query:**
   - If needed, create a function to get top k results without a threshold:
     ```sql
     CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_knowledge_top_k (query_embedding vector(3072), k integer)
     RETURNS SETOF knowledge
     LANGUAGE plpgsql
     AS $$
     BEGIN
       RETURN QUERY
       SELECT *
       FROM knowledge k
       ORDER BY (k.embedding::halfvec(3072) <=> query_embedding::halfvec(3072)) ASC
       LIMIT k;
     END;
     $$;
     ```
   - This helps verify if the search works, then refine the threshold.

#### Next Steps
If the top-k query returns results, adjust the threshold in `match_knowledge` for better filtering. If not, ensure your embedding generation and storage are correct, and check Supabase logs for errors.

### A Comprehensive Analysis on Resolving Semantic Search Issues in Next.js with Supabase and OpenAI Embeddings

This note provides an in-depth exploration of addressing semantic search failures in a Next.js personal assistant with memory, utilizing Supabase and pgvector for 3072-dimensional embeddings from OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model. The user reported zero results from semantic searches despite correct setup, and this analysis aims to offer a detailed, actionable solution based on relevant documentation and best practices.

#### Background and Problem Context
The user's setup involves a Next.js application (version 15.2.4) with TypeScript, integrated with Supabase for database operations and pgvector for vector similarity search. The issue is that semantic searches, performed via the `match_knowledge` Supabase function, consistently return zero results, even with test data inserted. Initial investigations revealed dimension mismatches (1536 vs. 3072) and attempts to use `halfvec` with HNSW indexing and L2 distance, but the problem persisted.

The user provided a link to Supabase's documentation on Next.js vector search, prompting a review of related resources to find a workable solution. Given the current date, April 6, 2025, and Supabase's support for pgvector 0.7.0, which introduced `halfvec`, this analysis focuses on leveraging recent updates and OpenAI's embedding characteristics.

#### Technical Stack and Initial Setup
- **Framework:** Next.js 15.2.4 with TypeScript
- **Database:** Supabase (Postgres) with pgvector extension (version supporting `halfvec`, likely >= 0.7.0)
- **Vector Type:** Column as `vector(3072)`, indexed with `halfvec(3072)` casting
- **Vector Index:** HNSW using `halfvec_l2_ops`
- **Embedding Model:** OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` (3072 dimensions)
- **Key Libraries:** `@supabase/supabase-js`, `ai` SDK, `@ai-sdk/openai`

The user's attempts included aligning the schema to `vector(3072)`, creating an HNSW index with `halfvec_l2_ops`, and modifying the SQL function to use L2 distance (`<->`), but searches still failed, suggesting a mismatch in distance metrics or threshold settings.

#### Analysis of OpenAI Embeddings and Distance Metrics
Research into OpenAI's documentation reveals that `text-embedding-3-large` embeddings are normalized to length 1, as stated in the FAQ: "OpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that: Cosine similarity can be computed slightly faster using just a dot product" ([OpenAI Embeddings FAQ](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6824809-embeddings-frequently-asked-questions)). This normalization implies that cosine similarity or inner product is more appropriate than L2 distance for similarity searches, as L2 distance on normalized vectors can be less intuitive due to the fixed length.

For pgvector, the `halfvec` type, introduced in version 0.7.0, supports operators like `<=>` for cosine distance and `<#>` for negative inner product, aligning with OpenAI's recommendations. The user's current use of L2 distance (`<->`) with `halfvec_l2_ops` may not leverage the normalization, potentially leading to no matches if thresholds are set incorrectly.

#### Proposed Solution: Switching to Cosine Distance
Given the normalization, it seems likely that switching to cosine distance will improve search results. The steps include:

1. **Creating an HNSW Index with Cosine Distance:**
   - Drop the existing index to avoid conflicts:
     ```sql
     DROP INDEX IF EXISTS knowledge_embedding_hnsw_halfvec_idx;
     ```
   - Create a new index using `halfvec_cosine_ops`:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX knowledge_embedding_hnsw_halfvec_cosine_idx
     ON public.knowledge
     USING hnsw ((embedding::halfvec(3072)) halfvec_cosine_ops);
     ```
   - This leverages pgvector's support for up to 4,000 dimensions with `halfvec`, suitable for 3072 dimensions.

2. **Updating the Supabase Function:**
   - Modify `match_knowledge` to use cosine distance (`<=>`), with a threshold adjusted for normalized vectors:
     ```sql
     CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_knowledge (query_embedding vector(3072), match_threshold float)
     RETURNS SETOF knowledge
     LANGUAGE plpgsql
     AS $$
     BEGIN
       RETURN QUERY
       SELECT *
       FROM knowledge k
       WHERE (k.embedding::halfvec(3072) <=> query_embedding::halfvec(3072)) < match_threshold
       ORDER BY (k.embedding::halfvec(3072) <=> query_embedding::halfvec(3072)) ASC;
     END;
     $$;
     ```
   - Cosine distance ranges from 0 to 2, with 0 being identical. Start with a threshold like 1.0 to ensure results, then refine based on relevance.

3. **Verifying Embedding Normalization:**
   - Check if stored embeddings are normalized using:
     ```sql
     SELECT id, l2_norm(embedding) FROM knowledge LIMIT 5;
     ```
   - Norms should be approximately 1.0, confirming OpenAI's normalization. If not, consider normalizing during insertion, though this is typically handled by OpenAI.

4. **Testing with Top-K Query:**
   - Create a function to retrieve top k results without a threshold for initial testing:
     ```sql
     CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_knowledge_top_k (query_embedding vector(3072), k integer)
     RETURNS SETOF knowledge
     LANGUAGE plpgsql
     AS $$
     BEGIN
       RETURN QUERY
       SELECT *
       FROM knowledge k
       ORDER BY (k.embedding::halfvec(3072) <=> query_embedding::halfvec(3072)) ASC
       LIMIT k;
     END;
     $$;
     ```
   - This helps verify if the search mechanism works, then adjust the threshold in `match_knowledge`.

#### Considerations and Trade-offs
Using `halfvec` reduces precision compared to `vector` due to 16-bit floats, but for similarity search, this loss is minimal, especially with normalized embeddings. The pgvector documentation notes benefits like halved storage costs and improved index build times ([What's new in pgvector v0.7.0](https://supabase.com/blog/pgvector-0-7-0)). However, users should monitor recall and performance, potentially tuning HNSW parameters like `ef_construction` for better results.

If cosine distance still fails, consider checking the query embedding generation (ensure correct API calls) and Supabase logs for errors. Alternatively, test with inner product (`<#>` with `halfvec_ip_ops`), though cosine distance is generally recommended for text embeddings.

#### Comparative Analysis of Distance Metrics
To organize the comparison, the following table summarizes key aspects of L2 distance and cosine distance for normalized embeddings:

| **Aspect**            | **L2 Distance (`<->`)**                     | **Cosine Distance (`<=>`)**                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Suitability**       | Less intuitive for normalized vectors       | Recommended for normalized embeddings       |
| **Range**             | 0 to infinity, depends on vector magnitude | 0 to 2, 0 being identical                  |
| **Index Operator**    | `halfvec_l2_ops`                           | `halfvec_cosine_ops`                       |
| **Performance**       | May require tighter thresholds             | Generally faster with normalized vectors    |
| **Use Case**          | General purpose, unnormalized vectors       | Text embeddings, semantic search            |

This table highlights that cosine distance is likely better for the user's scenario, given OpenAI's normalization.

#### Conclusion
The solution involves switching to cosine distance with `halfvec_cosine_ops` for indexing and `<=>` for queries, verifying embedding normalization, and testing with top-k queries to ensure results. This approach aligns with OpenAI's recommendations and pgvector's capabilities, addressing the zero-results issue by leveraging the appropriate distance metric for normalized embeddings.
